## Description
A basic programming language built for educational purposes. The exact details and intent of the project is currently being worked out as I mess around with creating this.  

**Project details and goals will grow as I figure out what is feasible and interesting to implement**  
The current goal is to create some sort of mix of C and Python that includes:  
- Garbage collection
- Uknown type requirements(as of now, leaning towards a strongly typed language)
- Fast operations(compared to python)
- python inspired readability
- A focus on data science, visualizations, and AI( Hopefully ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è )
